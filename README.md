### <a name="about"></a>About
&nbsp; Qualya is a Django-based application.

&nbsp; The model used to evaluate sentiment was trained on a wide variety of tagged segments. Keyword and keyword combinations compose the features, which are then weighted by the number and position of other keywords in the input status. The ultimate feature set is selected by the ordered information content. Finally, there are several component results in the ensemble that are then synthesized into a final score. The distribution over sentiment closely matches the actual tagged data.
