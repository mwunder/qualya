### <a name="about"></a>About

Qualya is a <a href="https://github.com/django/django">Django</a>-based application whose front-end depends on <a href="https://github.com/gionkunz/chartist-js">Chartist.js</a>.

The model used to evaluate sentiment was trained on a wide variety of tagged segments. Keyword and keyword combinations compose the features, which are then weighted by the number and position of other keywords in the input status. The ultimate feature set is selected by the ordered information content. Finally, there are several component results in the ensemble that are then synthesized into a final score. The distribution over sentiment closely matches the actual tagged data.

Each day, scores generated by the model are sorted into five sentiment categories: "Strongly-Negative" (crimson), "Negative" (red), "Neutral" (gray), "Positive" (light green) and "Strongly-Positive" (forest green). Below, on December 12th, 2016, TWTR had the following sentiment profile: 24.24% "Negative", 36.36% "Neutral", 30.3% "Positive" and 9.1% "Strongly-Positive".

Symbols are ranked according to a smoothed function of the number of scores collected for that day. To complement this, the heights of the sentiment bars are variable on this page to give a sense of the distance between rankings. This day, TWTR was considerably less-mentioned than AAPL, whose profile was 2.4% "Negative", 48.2% "Neutral", 47% "Positive" and 2.4% "Strongly-Positive".

Touch or click the arrow buttons in the sub-navigation menu to advance backward or forward one day in time. Do the same to any bar to view historical data for that symbol. Users can also adjust the date parameter in the URL directly.
